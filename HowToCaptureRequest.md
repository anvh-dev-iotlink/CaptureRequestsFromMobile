- Step 3: Install a CA certificate on your iOS device
  - In order to interact with HTTPS traffic, you need to install a CA certificate from your BurpSuite installation on your iOS device. To install the CA certificate to your iOS device:
  - Make sure that BurpSuite is running on your computer.
  - Use the browser on your iOS device to go to http://burpsuite and select CA Certificate.
  - When the CA certificate downloads, select Profile downloaded in the Settings menu.
  - On the Install Profile screen, select Install.

  - On the Installing Profile screen, select Install.
  - When the profile is installed, select Done.
  - Go to Settings > General > About > Certificate Trust Settings.
  - Activate the toggle switch for Portswigger CA.

- Step 4: Test the configuration
  - Open BurpSuite.
  - Go to Proxy > Intercept and click Intercept is off to switch intercept on.
  - Open the browser on your iOS device and go to an HTTPS web page.
  - The page should load without any security warnings. You should see the corresponding requests within BurpSuite.
## II. Android physical device.
- Step 1: The same with IOS
- Step 2: Configure your device to use the proxy
  - In your Android device, go to Settings > Network & internet.
  - Select Internet and long-press the name of your Wi-Fi network.
  - Select Modify.
  - From the Advanced options menu, select Proxy > Manual.
  - Set Proxy hostname to the IP of the computer running BurpSuite.
  - Set Proxy port to the port value that you configured for the Burp Proxy listener, in this example 8082.
  - Touch Save.
- Step 3: Install a CA certificate on your Android device
  - In order to interact with HTTPS traffic, you need to install a CA certificate from BurpSuite on your Android device. This step is complicated and it varies across devices and versions of Android.
  - In addition, you need to make further configuration changes in order to proxy HTTPS traffic from a Chrome browser that's at version 99 or above.
  - For further information on how to perform these steps, you can refer to the following external links. Please note that we're not responsible for the content of these pages:

- Step 4: Test the configuration
  - Open Burp Suite Professional.
  - Go to Proxy > Intercept and click Intercept is off to switch intercept on.
  - Open the browser on your Android device and go to an HTTPS web page.
  - The page should load without any security warnings. You should see the corresponding requests within Burp Suite Professional.
## III. Android emulator:
- Step 1: Export CA Certificate from Burp
  - Open burp and go to Proxy > Options tab and then click Import / export CA certificate.

  - Select DER format of certificate and save it as cacert.der
  - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58378623/225497074-d331bda2-58d9-4946-a605-ae6cfe9e4637.png)
- Step 2: Prepare the certificate before moving to Android device.
  - In this step, we need to change the certificate format and name it appropriately. `OpenSSL` is required for this step.
  - Open terminal in the directory where the certificate has been saved and then run `openssl x509 -inform DER -in cacert.der -out cacert.pem` to change its format.
  - Now we need to get the issuer hash value of the certificate, you can obtain this information with this commnad: `openssl x509 -inform PEM -subject_hash_old -in cacert.pem`.
  - Letâ€™s assume the output of the previous command is `9a5ba575`, now you have to rename the certificate to this value and add .0 extension: `mv cacert.pem 9a5ba575.0`.
- Step 3: Move certificate info system certificates.
  - Trusted Certificate Authorities are stored in `/system/etc/security/cacerts` on the Android system.
  - Start your Android Emulator with `-writable-system` flag. I recommend to use `API version < 29` of the emulator system due to issues with write permission to `/system` : `emulator -avd VirtualDeviceName -writable-system`
  - Restart adb as root: `adb root`
  - To get write access to /system run command: `adb remount`
  - Push the previously prepared certificate to system certificates and add appropriate permissions:`adb push 9a5ba575.0 /system/etc/security/cacerts` and `adb shell "chmod 664 /system/etc/security/cacerts/9a5ba575.0" `
  - The last step is to reboot the device: `adb reboot`
  - Now you should be able to see the `PortSwigger CA` on your device in `Settings -> Security -> Trusted Credentials`.

- Step 4: Configure proxy.
  - Configure you proxy by entering virtual device setting in Android Stuidio `Settings > Apperance & Behavior > System Settings > HTTP Proxy`.

  - Another method is to start the emulator from CLI with `-http-proxy` option: `emulator -avd VirtualDeviceName -writable-system -http-proxy 127.0.0.1:8082`
  - Remember that you <b>ALWAYS</b> have to start the emulator with the `-writable-system` option in order to use your certificate and make proxy working correctly
